🕵️‍♂️ CTF Challenge: Find Me (JWT nbf Exploit)

Welcome to Find Me, a web-based CTF challenge built for LNMI Hacks. This challenge tests players’ knowledge of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and their ability to exploit the nbf (Not Before) field.

🧠 Challenge Summary

The site says:
🚫 This site will be accessible after <future date>

But… what if you could change time itself?

Participants are issued a JWT with a future nbf timestamp. The server fails to validate this properly. Can you manipulate the token to access the site early and capture the flag?

💻 Tech Stack

Node.js (Express.js)

JSON Web Tokens (jsonwebtoken)

Docker-ready

🚩 Objective

Access the /flag route before the allowed time by modifying the JWT.
The flag is revealed only if the server accepts a tampered token.
